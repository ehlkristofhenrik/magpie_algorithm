    "The magpie algorithm is a destructive implementation of linear regression. Unlike Gradient Descent $^{[1]}$ the magpie algorithm uses N-dimensional vectors. The major selling point of the algorithm is the way it handles outliers. Outliers are discriminated and have very little effect on the rest of the calculations. Where other manual methods fail the magpie algorithm shines. With the good set of hyperparameters the algorithm can give a best fit line without fear of overfitting.\n",

    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read in data.\n",
    "2. Split data into 2 parts.\n",
    "3. Do the algorithm on both.\n",
    "4. Extract line from the 2 remaining points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sum up the vectors and weights.\n",
    "2. Each vector will be updated by the formulae $ \\sum_{i}^N \\alpha \\frac {v_j-v_i} {|v_j-v_i|} \\frac {w_j} {w_i}$.\n",
    "3. After each iteration, remove one of the points close to the other.\n",

    "### Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is based on the law of gravitation $^{[2]}$. We treat every datapoint as a physical object and we simulate gravitational attraction between them. Since there is no velocity involved, they converge to one singularity."
